        Every great world begins with a spark… and sometimes, with a rupture. Disaster Forge Studio was born in the blast radius — a place where broken ideas, lost momentum, and stalled ambition get reforged into something stronger. In the flames I found order. In the chaos I learned control. Creation is my arena.

        I channel the spirit of battle anime — the relentless climb, the training arcs, the final forms. Think Goku’s resolve, Yami Sukehiro’s indomitable will, Garp’s unshakable presence. Not aesthetics for aesthetics’ sake, but the discipline behind the power. That’s the engine that drives my craft.

        I’m Talal Fayyaz — designer, developer, motion artist, marketer. One person, many forms. I build identities that command attention, products that get used, and systems that scale. I don’t just make things look good — I make them work, sell, and last.
